		<h3>House Stark</h3>
		<picture><img src="411a.png" alt="stark-nails"></picture>
		<p>House Stark are the wardens of the North and one of the oldest noble families in Westeros. Believed to be descended from the First Men thousands of years ago, House Stark have faced many trials and tribulations over the course of the past five seasons. Will they finally triumph over the darker forces in Westeros or will they become a part of Westerosi history and be no more?</p>
		<p>This nail art is based on the Stark family sigil, the direwolf. Using metallic grey as a base colour and textured white and grey for the sigil, you can see that while the family sigil is one of strength, it could be easily worn away over time...</p>

		<h3>House Lannister</h3>
		<picture><img src="423.png" alt="lannister-nails"></picture>
		<p>The Lannisters are known for their blonde hair, apparent beauty and their vicious temperament. Their family seat is at Casterly Rock on the western coast of Westeros. Get on the wrong side of a Lannister and you could be in a lot of trouble. Their family motto is 'A Lannister always pays his debts' but I'd be careful if you owed them anything...</p>
		<p>Based on the family sigil, the lion, this Lannister nail art makes use of the red and gold colour scheme found on the family's banners. The filigree design in gold hints at the Lannisters' wealth but rumour has it that the family gold isn't as plentiful as it was before.</p>

		<h3>House Targaryen</h3>
		<picture><img src="413.png" alt="targaryen-nails"></picture>
		<p>The Targaryens ruled over Westeros for thousands of years before the Mad King was killed by his own Kingsguard, Jaime Lannister. Once the rulers of the Western continent, Danerys Targaryen is the last remaining heir to the Targaryen throne. As Queen of the Dragons, she hopes to conquer Westeros and sit on the Iron Throne.</p>
		<p>Based upon the family's affinity for dragons and its house sigils, this black and red design reflects the dark and violent history of this ancient house as well as the family's motto, Fire and Blood.</p>

		<h3>House Baratheon</h3>
		<picture><img src="424.png" alt="baratheon-nails"></picture>
		<p>Currently the ruling family of Westeros, the Baratheons came to power during Robert's Rebellion. Robert Baratheon launched a coup against the Mad King and with the help of other noble families like the Starks, the late King Robert lay claim to the throne. The current king is Tommen, second son of Robert. Tommen ascended the throne after his brother Joffrey died after being poisoned at his own wedding reception.</p>
		<p>Another design based on the family sigil, the yellow and black are the family colours with the stag being the Baratheon sigil. Unfortunately, there wasn't enough room to write the family's motto, Ours is the Fury.</p>

		<h3>Dragon Eggs</h3>
		<picture><img src="124a.png" alt="dragon-nails"></picture>
		<p>All dragons were thought to have been wiped out during the Doom of Valyria but the Targaryens possessed the only survivors of the species. Up until very recently it was thought that dragons had been erased from this world entirely but a wedding present for Danerys Targaryen soon produced three dragons that would soon help her on her quest for power.</p>
		<p>These dragon egg nails use a cool iridescent polish to get the duochrome effect of dragon scales without having to do too much work with shade and light. A striper brush is used to to create the outlines of the scales, as well as the shade and light needed to produce that 3D effect.</p>

		<h3>Queen Margaery's Wedding Dress</h3>
		<picture><img src="065c.png" alt="margaery-nails"></picture>
		<p>As the Tyrell's sigil is the rose, it was no suprise that this floral motif made its way onto Margaery's gown for her wedding to Joffrey Baratheon. While the wedding day may have ended on a sour note, the Queen kept up appearences all day.</p> 
		<p>The cool blue shade and metallic rose and thornes ensure that while she may appear to be a delicate rose, Margaery Tyrell's thornes should not be discounted.</p>
