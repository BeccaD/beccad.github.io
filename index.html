		<h2>The Game of Thrones Nail Art Guide by Flails and Nails</h2>
	<div class="intro">
		<small><p>Welcome to the home of Game of Thrones nail art created by nail blogger Flails and Nails. On this site you will be able to see nail art inspired by the hit HBO series and learn all about the dark and dangerous world created by George R. R. Martin. Be careful! Dragons lurk around these parts...</p></small>

		<h3>House Stark</h3>
		<p>House Stark are the wardens of the North and one of the oldest noble families in Westeros. Believed to be descended from the First Men thousands of years ago, House Stark have faced many trials and tribulations over the course of the past five seasons. Will they finally triumph over the darker forces in Westeros or will they become a part of Westerosi history and be no more?</p>
		
		<p>This nail art is based on the Stark family sigil, the direwolf. Using metallic grey as a base colour and textured white and grey for the sigil, you can see that while the family sigil is one of strength, it could be easily worn away over time...</p>

	<div class="family-houses">
		<h3>House Lannister</h3>
		<p>The Lannisters are known for their blonde hair, apparent beauty and their vicious temperament. Get on the wrong side of a Lannister and you could be in a lot of trouble. Their family motto is 'A Lannister always pays his debts' but I'd be careful if you owed them anything...</p>

		<p>Based on the family sigil, the lion, this Lannister nail art makes use of the red and gold colour scheme found on the family's banners. The filigree design in gold hints at the Lannisters' wealth but rumour has it that the family gold isn't as plentiful as it was before.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="family-houses">
		<h3>House Targaryen</h3>
		<p>The Targaryens ruled over Westeros for thousands of years before the Mad King was killed by his own Kingsguard, Jaime Lannister. Once the rulers of the West, Danerys Targaryen is the last remaining heir to the Targaryen throne. As Queen of the Dragons, she hopes to conquer Westeros and sit on the Iron Throne and be a fair and just ruler, unlike her father.</p>

		<p>Based upon the family's affinity for dragons and its house sigils, this black and red design reflects the dark and violent history of this ancient house as well as the family's motto, Fire and Blood.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="family-houses">
		<h3>House Baratheon</h3>
		<p>Currently the ruling family of Westeros, the Baratheons came to power during Robert's Rebellion. Robert Baratheon launched a coup against the Mad King and with the help of other noble families like the Starks, the late King Robert lay claim to the throne. The current king is Tommen, second son of Robert. Tommen ascended the throne after his brother Joffrey died after being poisoned at his own wedding reception. Many consider his death a necessary evil.

		<p>Another design based on the family sigil, the yellow and black are the family colours with the stag being the Baratheon sigil. Unfortunately, there wasn't enough room to write the family's motto, Ours is the Fury.</p>
